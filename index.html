              "The avocado is a medium-sized, evergreen tree in the laurel
              family. It is native to the Americas and was first domesticated by
              Mesoamerican tribes more than 5,000 years ago. Then as now it was
              prized for its large and unusually oily fruit. The tree likely
              originated in the highlands bridging south-central Mexico and
              Guatemala."
